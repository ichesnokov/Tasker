To install Tasker type the following:

1. mysql -u root -pXXXXX < /etc/tasker.sql

   Where XXXXX is your MySQL root password.

   This creates a 'tasker' database and assigns privileges on it
   to tasker_user user.

   Users 'user' with password 'user' and 'admin' with password 'admin'
   will be created automatically.

2. perl Makefile.PL && make

3. Run script/tasker_server.pl to test the application.

4. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000, log in with user or admin access
   and try to operate on tickets.
